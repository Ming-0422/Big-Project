1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,880
As a futurist, I think the two most dangerous words in the English language are unimaginable

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,680
and unthinkable.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,200
So I want to invite you to think creatively and courageously about some hard to imagine

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,280
possibilities.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,680
Let's play a game of what if?

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll describe three hypothetical future scenarios.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,120
If you try to imagine how you would feel and what you would do if you woke up in these

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,040
trained new worlds.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,560
Future number one.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,360
It's 2033.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,600
Extreme heat, wildfire, and droughts have been worse than even the most dire climate predictions.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,000
So now, geoengineering is up for a global vote.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,040
Nine billion people are eligible to vote yes or no on a 10-year plan of aggressive solar

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,360
radiation management.

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,600
Using sulfate particles into the atmosphere to block some of the sun's rays.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,440
The election is called Sun Exit.

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,520
They're saying a yes on Sun Exit could bring about a 10-year winter, but it could also

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,400
solve some of our biggest climate challenges.

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,120
Is it worth the risks, the unintended consequences?

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,840
How would you vote?

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,400
How would you educate yourself to be ready to vote?

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,200
Nero update, Sun Exit past, we're doing it.

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,480
Solar radiation management starts in 10 days.

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,640
Now how do you feel?

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,480
What do you do in the next 10 days to get ready?

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,720
Okay, it's one year later.

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,520
The geoengineering is working.

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,240
Yes, but paradoxically, trust and science is now at an all-time low.

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,480
People are saying they're a mental and physical side effects.

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,880
Is it just misinformation?

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,080
What do you do to stay healthy?

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
New future.

33
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,300
It's 2029 now, and your federal government has gone full-blown zero-waste authoritarian

34
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,300
style.

35
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,480
It is now illegal to throw anything away.

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,800
They literally took everyone's garbage cans.

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,280
Now composting still allowed recycling never worked in garbage.

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
You can't make any of it.

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Nothing.

40
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
But there's some good news.

41
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,680
Psychologists have invented a new word to capture the positive emotion that defines life

42
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,360
in a zero-waste age.

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Aureforia.

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,080
It's a combination of joy, pride and resourcefulness, a lightness of being that comes from wasting

45
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,600
nothing and leaving no trace behind.

46
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,840
How do you react to these changes?

47
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,160
Do you learn new habits?

48
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Help others adapt or do you rise up enjoying the protrage resistance or become a reformer

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,560
for those ways to make zero-waste society better?

50
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,240
Okay, let's imagine one final future.

51
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
This is 2031.

52
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,720
Climate migration is on the rise.

53
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,320
Countries with low fertility rates are competing with each other for immigrants.

54
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,200
Governments are building climate-resilient welcome cities and paying people to move there.

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,720
It's part of a new geopolitical movement called the Welcome Party.

56
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:17,120
Up to 1 billion people are expected to climate relocate with assistance over the next decade.

57
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,360
You have been asked to take a personal survey of climate risk and intention to migrate.

58
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,440
The Welcome Party is collecting data to simulate and plan a safe and equitable mass climate

59
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,040
migration.

60
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,320
You have to name three climate-resilient cities you would be willing to move to, given social

61
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,760
and economic support.

62
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,120
Which three cities do you name?

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,400
How prepared do you feel to consider this question?

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,440
Why am I posing these hypotheticals?

65
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
Well, take a look at this data.

66
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,240
These two charts show how often we use the words unimaginable and unthinkable in our

67
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,000
journalism.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,840
Look how common they've become.

69
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,760
We are so often shocked and blindsided by how the future unfolds, but it doesn't have

70
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,480
to be that way.

71
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,880
At the Nonprofit Institute for the Future in Palo Alto, California, I hope people build

72
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,520
imagination leadership skills by simulating hard-to-imagine futures like you've thought

73
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,240
about today.

74
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,600
Our goal is to improve everyone's scores on three measures of future imagination like

75
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,280
mental flexibility.

76
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,560
On a scale of one to ten, how plausible or realistic is this future scenario?

77
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,480
In other words, is it thinkable to you?

78
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,920
Also, realistic hope.

79
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,800
On a scale of one to ten, how worried or excited would you be to wake up in this future?

80
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,400
We want you to anticipate new risks, but also opportunities for positive transformation.

81
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,520
And finally, future power.

82
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,160
On a scale of one to ten, how ready do you feel to help yourself and others if this future

83
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,400
were really to happen?

84
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,400
This is the number we see go up the most after people imagine themselves taking action

85
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,000
in a hypothetical world.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So the next time you have an instinct to describe a possibility as unthinkable or unimaginable,

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,720
wait, play with that possibility instead.

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,440
Help us become a community, a society that can confidently say, we can face and we can

89
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,280
solve previously unimaginable challenges together.

90
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,840
For us, there are no unthinkable futures.

91
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,080
Thank you.
